#' classifyWetlands classifies wetlands (really!) using the wetlands layer set as input and a either LCC05 or LCC2010
#'
#' @param LCC numeric. 2005 (250m resolution) or 2010 (30m resolution) landcover  rasters.
#'
#' @param wetLayerInput Which wetland should be used as input (raster with projection).
#'                      It was originally designed to work with the DUCKS Unlimited Waterland
#'                      layer (30m) but can work with any waterlayers that have the following code:
#'                      possibleLakes == 0
#'                      water bodies == 1
#'                      wetlands == 2
#'                      uplands > 2
#'
#'  @param pathData Where the layers are stored and/or should be saved to
#'
#'  @param studyArea If the layer should be cropped and masked after classification. Optional.
#'
#'  @param RasterToMatch raster to match the new layer after classification to. Optional.
#'
#'
#' @return As with \code{\link[archivist]{cache}}, returns the value of the
#' function call or the cached version (i.e., the result from a previous call
#' to this same cached function with identical arguments).
